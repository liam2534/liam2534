      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. Simplified, there is a program running that is communicating with p5 that changes the screen pending the position of the joystick, as well as when the mouse is clicked or not. Clicking the mouse also turns on the red LED.

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A6-Folder/a6schem.png"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. The joystick does not need resistors. As the calculation shows, I'm using a 220ohm resistor for the red LED, as justified by the calculation (desired current for red LED is 20mA).</p>
      <p>Note: Pins A0 and A1, which are both executing analogRead(), will output values between 0-1023, pending the position of the joystick.</p>
      <p>Note 2: Regarding analogRead(), this function will return a value between 0-1023 (10 bit number) that is proportional to the voltage that the anolog pins, in this case A0 and A1, are reading at the time.
        The joystick has two 10k potentiometers (according to the data sheet), corresponding to the "x and y" position of the joystick, in it that change pending that position. Thus, when the resistance changes, the voltage
        that the analog pins read changes proportionally.
