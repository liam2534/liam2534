      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. There are 3 LEDs that have alternative functions pending the state of the button on the right.
        The button on the left stays on and switches to a pulsing state, the middle button starts pulsing and switches off, and the 
        button on the right starts off and then pulses when the button is pressed.

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A2-Photos/A2Calculations.webp"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. As shown by my work, I ended up using 220 ohm resistors because I did not have 160 ohm resistors.
        I also used the 10k resistor because it acts as a pull down resistor for the button. Work and explanations are present in the image.

        <p>This code has comments on every line that explain what it does, but in general, there are two states for each button so they exibit different behavior
          pending the state of the button, being on or off.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255).</h3>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="A2-Photos/A2P1.webp"/>
      <p>This is the graph of Volts over time (seconds) for the outlined scenario. These values were attained by a voltmeter.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</h3>
      <img width="100%" height="auto" src="A2-Photos/A2P2.webp"/>
      <p>In my answer, which is explained in detail in the above photo, I cover two possible situations, being both the button unpressed and pressed states of my circuit, with clear assumptons and justifications
        for each situation.</p>
