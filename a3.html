      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. There are 2 LEDs that change state pending the state of the LDR and voltage divider. The Green LED's brightness corresponds to the 
        value outputted by the voltage divider. When the LDR is exposed to more light, the resistance is lower, and the voltage read by the voltage divider
        is higher, thus the green light is brighter. This is also why when the LDR is covered, the green LED dims. The red LED simply turns on when the 
        voltage divider reaches about halfway between the highest and lowest value it read during my testing.

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A3-Folder/A3-schematic.webp"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. As shown by my work, I ended up using 220 ohm resistors because I did not have 160 ohm resistors for the red & green LEDs.
        I also used the 10k resistor so it can restrict the current down to 0.5mA (5V/10000ohms=0.5mA) in case the LDR gave 0 ohms of resistance. Work and explanations for voltage out values and 
        resistance for the LDR in light and dark conditions are present in the image.

        <p>This code has comments on every line that explain what it does, but in general, pin 5 mirrors the voltage value from A0, and 
          pin 6 is either set to output 0 or 5 volts pending the voltage value from A0. Also, the values read fro AO, the mapped corresponding value for 
          pin 5, and the value I use to check if pin 6 should be HIGH or LOW are printed to the Serial Monitor.

        <p>
          This is an example of what you would see on the Serial Monitor. The higher values are when the LDR is uncovered, and thus the voltage divider is reading high values.
          The opposite is true for the lower values, which is when the LDR is covered.

      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A3-Folder/A3-thumbnail.webp"/>
      <p>This is a still image of my final circuit! The video at the top of the page does a better job showing what it actually does.</p>

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</h3>
      <img width="70%" height="auto" src="./A3-Folder/A3P1.jpeg"/>
      <p>You cannot switch the values for R1 and R2 because that would change the V-out from what it is in reality.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</h3>
      <img width="70%" height="auto" src="./A3-Folder/A3P2.jpeg"/>
      <p>This graph shows what voltage the voltage divider would read over the course of someone covering the LDR with their hand slowly, similar to what I did in the video
        at the top of the page. The high and low values were calculated at the top-right corner of the schematic page.
      </p>
      <h3>3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h3>
