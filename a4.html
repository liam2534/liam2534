      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. There is a PIR that triggers a small servo motor for a short period of time when it detects movement.

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A4-Folder/a4Schematic.jpg"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. The PIR and servo motor do not need resistors. They are set up in parallel to a 5V power supply.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        <code> for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}</code> Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h3>
      
      <img width="70%" height="auto" src="./A4-Folder/a4p1.webp"/>
      <p>The graph models the voltage at pin 9 over 2 seconds with the given code.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
      <br>
      <code> 
        loop{
          //check if current value is 1, which is "movement"
          if(P.read() ==1){
            //delay for a while to make sure that the "HIGH/1" inputs stop if it's fake. 
            delay(500);
            if(P.read() == 1)
            //Do thing
            //This will only be triggered if someone is still moving their hand after half a second
            //The the first check in this loop triggers when the PIR is set off the first time, the second if statement makes sure the reading is legit.
          }
        }
      </code>
      <p>The mix of pseudocode and "code" has explanations and justifications assuming that I'm using a .</p>
      <br>
      <h3>3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
      <code>
        //based on how the question is worded, I am going to assume it's either up or down 10% and never exactly correct.
        //Thus, one way to help mitigate the noise is to find the average between the two numbers it's supposed to be,
        //in other word
        loop{
          //store last value in a variable 
          int lastVal = whatever.Read();
          //actual value if lastVal (aka measured value) was 10% below actual value
          int aboveVal = lastVal/.9;
          //actual value if lastVal (aka measured value) was 10% above actual value
          int belowVal = lastVal/1.1;

          //find the avg for the two values
          int avgVal = (aboveVal + belowVal)/2;
        }
      </code>
      <p>The mix of pseudocode and code has comments that explain my thinking.</p>
