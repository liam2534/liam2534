      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. There is a PIR that triggers a small servo motor for a short period of time when it detects movement.

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A4-Folder/a4Schematic.jpg"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. The PIR and servo motor do not need resistors. They are set up in parallel to a 5V power supply.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        <code> for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}</code> Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h3>
      
      <img width="70%" height="auto" src="./A4-Folder/a4p1.webp"/>
      <p>The graph models the voltage at pin 9 over 2 seconds with the given code.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
      <img width="70%" height="auto" src="./A3-Folder/A3P2.jpeg"/>
      <p>This graph shows what voltage the voltage divider would read over the course of someone covering the LDR with their hand slowly, similar to what I did in the video
        at the top of the page. The high and low values were calculated at the top-right corner of the schematic page.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
      <p>The map() function in my code would need to become map(some-value, 0, 65535, 0, 1023). This is because if analogRead() returns a 16 bit number, it would return a number betweeen
        0 and 65,535, and I would need to remap that value to something between 0 and 1023 so I can pass that value into a hypothetical analogWrite() function that
        takes in an 8 bit number, which the latter range falls into.
