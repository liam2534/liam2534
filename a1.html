    <h1>Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>

      <p>Here is a video of my basic arduino circuit. Its function, which can be seen, is for it to have each LED blink in succession.</p>

      <h2>The Schematic:</h2>
      <img width="50%" height="auto" src="A1-Schematic.jpg"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. As shown by my work, I ended up using 220 ohm resistors because I did not have 160 ohm resistors.</p>

          <code>void setup() {
            //Set up for loop to initialize pins
            for(int i=10; i <= 12; i++){
              //i corresponds to pin #, output is so the pin voltage is set to 5V or 0V
              pinMode(i, OUTPUT);
            }
          }
          
          void loop() {
            //introduce int "time" so that if someone wanted to change the delay,
            //they would only have to change one number instead of two.
            int time = 1000;
          
            //introduce for loop, i represents each pin #. It will cycle through each pin: 10-12.
            for(int i=10; i <= 12; i++){
              //sets pin i's voltage to HIGH (5V)
              digitalWrite(i, HIGH);
              //delays for "time" ms to keep light on for a moment
              delay(time);
              //sets pin i's voltage to LOW (OV), turning it off.
              digitalWrite(i, LOW);
              //delays for "time" ms to keep light off for a moment
              delay(time);
            }
          }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>The code is pretty simple. I opted to use loops because I thought it would be more readable than copy-pasting similar lines of code.</p>

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h3>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="A1-Graph.jpg"/>
      <p>This is the graph of Volts over time (seconds) for the circuit that I made.</p>
      <h3>2: How many LEDs could you blink at once with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h3>

      <h3>3: How many LEDs could you blink with your Arduino if only one were to be on at once?</h3>

      <h3>4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
      <p>If we assume that people can see an absolute maximum of 60 frames per second, we can calculate the frequency of </p>
      <p>which we would need to blink the light where the blinking would become imperceptible:</p>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="A1-Freq.jpg"/>
      <p>The calculation shows that we need to have the LED blink every 0.01667 seconds.</p>
