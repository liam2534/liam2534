      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. Simplified, there is a PIR that triggers an LED light strip to turn on..

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>
      <img width="80%" height="auto" src="./A4-Folder/a4Schematic.jpg"/>
      <p>This is my written out schematic. The PIR and LED Strip do not need resistors. The PIR and LED Strip are powered by different power supplies.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        <code> for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}</code> Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h3>
      
      <img width="70%" height="auto" src="./A4-Folder/a4p1.webp"/>
      <p>The graph models the voltage at pin 9 over 2 seconds with the given code. This is also "assuming" that it takes the servo motor 100ms to move 1 degree.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
      <br>
      <pre>
      <code> 
          loop{
            //check if current value is 1, which is "movement"
            if(P.read() ==1){
              //delay for a while to make sure that the "HIGH/1" inputs stop if it's fake. 
              delay(500);
              if(P.read() == 1)
              //Do thing
              //This will only be triggered if someone is still moving their hand after half a second
              //The the first check in this loop triggers when the PIR is set off the first time, the second if statement makes sure the reading is legit.
            }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>The mix of pseudocode and "code" has explanations and justifications assuming that I'm using a PIR.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          //based on how the question is worded, I am going to assume it's either up or down 10% and never exactly correct.
          //Thus, one way to help mitigate the noise is to find the average between the two numbers it's supposed to be,
          //in other word
          loop{
            //store last value in a variable 
            int lastVal = whatever.Read();
            //actual value if lastVal (aka measured value) was 10% below actual value
            int aboveVal = lastVal/.9;
            //actual value if lastVal (aka measured value) was 10% above actual value
            int belowVal = lastVal/1.1;

            //find the avg for the two values
            int avgVal = (aboveVal + belowVal)/2;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>The mix of pseudocode and code has comments that explain my thinking. I'm also answering this question as if I was using a different input device that could give me more complex values that are not 0 or 1.</p>
