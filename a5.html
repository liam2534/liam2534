      <p>This is a video of my Arduino circuit. Simplified, there is a PIR that triggers an LED light strip to turn on..

      <h2>The Schematic & Calculations:</h2>

      <p>This is my written out schematic. The PIR and LED Strip do not need resistors. The PIR and LED Strip are powered by different power supplies. Voltages and currents after the PIR and LED Strip are given. Also, according to the 
        data sheet, at room temperature and 10V, max continuous current is 37.2 A. Either way, the current running through the transistor (1.7A) is significantly less than 37.2A.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>1: What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?</h3>
      <p>According to the datasheet of the component,the maximum body diode forward current is 80A, however, its at room temperature and 10V, max continuous current is 37.2 A under normal operating conditions.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components.</h3>

      <p>This is the schematic for question 3. Pins 4, 5, 12, and 13 of the L293D chip are connected to ground.</p>
